## Academic Achievements 

### My First Unofficial Official ACM ICPC Contest

  I did actually have a chance to take part in this important Competitive Programming contest during my time as a member of our school's Informatics Team. 
While it might not have been impressive getting only "Honorable Mention", it was really fun being able to showcase our programming skills and understand 
where we were compared to other students, especially to undergraduates. I did manage to solve a few interesting Geometry Problems, too!

### The First NOI
  
  I was blessed to be chosen for the Vietnamese National Olympiad in Informatics. As a result, I was exposed to an imense amount of knowledge and I was able 
to study and work with lots of great people. Third Prize might be trivial and might be discouraging to me at first, but it is a small step towards many great
things that would come in the future.

### The Second NOI
  
  This time, it is a different story. After my utter defeat, I was technically out of the competition, considering that I was not qualified for the second round
that would eventually lead to APIO and IOI. However, it has been a long time that our school had a collaboration with the National University of Singapore. They 
are the host of the annual Singapore National Olympiad and they often invite schools from around South East Asia to bring in students and compete. That is when I 
realized this was my last chance to do something impactful during my time as a competitive programmer. And I did! 10th place and a shiny Gold Medal.

### Odon Vallet Scholaraship 2019

This is a scholarship given to those with exceptional talent or achievements during the past year. Doesn't have much meaning behind it, but it does make a good 
trophy considering that only 0.1% (or even lower) students in Vietnam has the privilege to achieve one.

### Silicon Valley International Invention Festival

  After studying programming for over 4 years, I decided to branch out and try something new. I have always had a passion for biology and so I joined a project in 
researching alternative cures for gout. We tried extracting and using caffeic acid from Vietnamese Perilla frutescens in an attempt to reduce gout pain. It was definitely
interesting, being able to work in a laboratory and performing experiments on cells and even mice. In the end, our project was apporoved and we got permission to go 
to the USA and present our project to businessmen and representatives around the world. It was a really fun trip, and I did get to bring home a Silver Medal, completing
the trifecta of medals on my shelf. Oh I did get to go to Googleplex, Facebook HQ and Apple Park while I was there, too!

### CodeChef Snackdown 2019: 
  
  Could have done better but a T-shirt is very fine for me. Top 300 teams only, which means this T-shirt is 1 in 600!

## Extracurricular Activities

### English Club Activities
  
  I was given the ability to study English when I was only five years old. As a result, I am bound to include English in my everyday life, from listening to US/UK songs, 
reading books to listening to the news and watching videos on YouTube. This made it possible for me to keep up my passion for English and continue to pursue the act of 
helping others to develop their English skills. Therefore, during my time in high school, I decided to join the English Club. Here are the two activities that I was able 
to take part in before my time in the National Informatics Team: 

- English Speaking Mondays:
  
  Students in my school come from all around Northern Vietnam and it is clearly obvious that each student's English proficiency drastically differs from one another. 
Therefore, me and my upperclassmen decided to organize "English Speaking Mondays." During our term as English Club Members, we successfully host ten weeks of continuous 
English speaking events, from conducting the weekly report to holding games for other students to play. This gave me the golden chance to be nominated as the 2018
Representative of the School!

- English Celebration:
  
  This is one of our school's most important event each year. Not only do we choose out the King and Queen of our school in this event, but we also have the opportunity to 
embrace the Western prom night, where couples or friends get to dance together. As an administrator for the first year and an adviser for the second year, I am absolutely 
happy to not just help create one of the most enjoyable nights of the year but help bring everyone in our community closer together.

### HSGS Code Camp

  I inherited the love for teaching from my mother. Since I was a kid, I have always wanted to help others develop their skills and their abilities. That is why when I find
out that there was an opportunity for me to reach out and help expose secondary school students to the interesting world of programming, I was not hesitant. Two years of 
teaching and organizing code camps taught me a lot about the Vietnamese demographic and how to most effectively demonstrate knowledge to children and minimize the "Magic" in 
every piece of code.

### Science Camps

  I was given the opportunity to attend 2 Science Code Camps during my time as a student in HSGS. 

- Talinpa Science Camp: 
  This is an event that help those in the National Olympiad Teams acquire knowledge on their preferred subjects. We were taught by renowned professors and participated in informatics competition, organized by Talinpa Talent Center, founded by Professor Chau Ngo, Fields Medalist and Mathematics Professor at the University of Chicago.
