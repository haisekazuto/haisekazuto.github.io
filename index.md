## Academic Achievements 

### My First Unofficial Official ACM ICPC Contest

  I did actually have a chance to take part in this important Competitive Programming contest during my time as a member of our school's Informatics Team. 
While it might not have been impressive getting only "Honorable Mention", it was really fun being able to showcase our programming skills and understand 
where we were compared to other students, especially to undergraduates. I did manage to solve a few interesting Geometry Problems, too!

### The First NOI
  
  I was blessed to be chosen for the Vietnamese National Olympiad in Informatics. As a result, I was exposed to an imense amount of knowledge and I was able 
to study and work with lots of great people. Third Prize might be trivial and might be discouraging to me at first, but it is a small step towards many great
things that would come in the future.

### The Second NOI
  
  This time, it is a different story. After my utter defeat, I was technically out of the competition, considering that I was not qualified for the second round
that would eventually lead to APIO and IOI. However, it has been a long time that our school had a collaboration with the National University of Singapore. They 
are the host of the annual Singapore National Olympiad and they often invite schools from around South East Asia to bring in students and compete. That is when I 
realized this was my last chance to do something impactful during my time as a competitive programmer. And I did! 10th place and a shiny Gold Medal.

### Odon Vallet Scholaraship 2019
  This is a scholarship given to those with exceptional talent or achievements during the past year. Doesn't have much meaning behind it, but it does make a good 
trophy considering that only 0.1% (or even lower) students in Vietnam has the privilege to achieve one.

### Silicon Valley International Invention Festival
  After studying programming for over 4 years, I decided to branch out and try something new. I have always had a passion for biology and so I joined a project in 
researching alternative cures for gout. We tried extracting and using caffeic acid from Vietnamese Perilla frutescens to try and reduce gout pain. It was definitely
interesting being able to work in a laboratory and performing experiments on cells and even mice. In the end, our project was apporoved and we got permission to go 
to the USA and present our project to businessmen and representatives around the world. It was a really fun trip, and I did get to bring home a Silver Medal, completing
the trifecta of medals on my shelf. Oh I did get to go to Googleplex, Facebook HQ and Apple Park while I was there, too!
