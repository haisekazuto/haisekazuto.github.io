# Welcome to Quang Nguyen's Profile Page!

This is just an experimental "Website" that I create to tell everyone about myself and the activities that
I have done and still doing throughout Highschool. 

## Academic Achievements 

### My First Unofficial Official ACM ICPC Contest

  I did actually have a chance to take part in this important Competitive Programming contest during my time as a member of our school's Informatics Team. 
While it might not have been impressive getting only "Honorable Mention", it was really fun being able to showcase our programming skills and understand 
where we were compared to other students, especially to undergraduates. I did manage to solve a few interesting Geometry Problems, too!
